# React - useEffect Hook

# Todos
1. Implement a function that will handle getting a random user when the Button **Get Random User** is clicked.
 - This can be achieved by tracking the url in state and updating the parameter using the numbers between 1 and 10
2. When the search param is clicked, render the single user card, otherwise, render the entire users list
3. Use the url as the dependency inside the useEffect hook, such that it loads everytime the URL changes.
4. Add a button **Get All Users** that when clicked will fetch all the 10 users and display them.
